1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.
  Added Animal.java and Dog.java
  
2. What five objects are created in the main?
  One "List", Three "Dogs", One "Comparator".
  
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
  The call is on line 16 of MyCompare3.java, where it says "new Comparator()". The class definition is in Collections.sort() method.
